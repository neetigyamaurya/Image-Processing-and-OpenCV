""" Object Tracking using Meanshift Algorithm.
The idea behind this algorithm is to move small window to get the high density pixels same as histogram backprojection.

Steps to use this algorithm are: 1 Set up the target
                                 2 Find its histogram.
                                 3 Set one initial location.
                                 4. Set up the termination criteria.
